## Cloud Monitoring to monitor GKE cluster infrastructure, Istio, and applications deployed on GKE

### IMPLEMENT
    # Create a GKE cluster

    # Deploy a microservices application to it

    # Define latency and error SLIs and SLOs for it

    # Configure Cloud Monitoring to monitor your SLIs

    # Deploy a breaking change to the application and use Cloud Monitoring to troubleshoot and resolve the issues that result

    # Validate that your resolution addresses the SLO violation

### Target: Learn

    # How to deploy a microservices application on an existing GKE cluster

    # How to select appropriate SLIs/SLOs for an application

    # How to implement SLIs using Cloud Monitoring features

    # How to use Cloud Trace, Profiler, and Debugger to identify software issues
